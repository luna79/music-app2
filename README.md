# Music App
🎧 Music App UI
A modern and minimalist music application user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project fetches a dynamic list of lo-fi songs from the iTunes Search API, showcasing best practices in code organization and component-based design.

The primary goal of this project was to refactor a single-file application into a modular and scalable component structure.

✨ Key Features
Modern Design: A responsive and visually appealing interface, styled entirely with Tailwind CSS.

Reusable Components: The codebase is organized into reusable React components like Player, TrackList, and FollowButton for better maintainability.

Dynamic Data: Song information is fetched in real-time from the iTunes Search API.

Interactive Functionality: Simulates song playback, track navigation, and user-to-artist following.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A fast build tool for modern web development.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.

Lucide Icons: An open-source icon library.

GitHub Projects: Used for task management and workflow organization.
