# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
Music App UI
Project Description
This project is a single-page music application built with React. Its main goal is to demonstrate a clean and modern user interface for a music player, showing a tracklist, playback controls, and interactive elements like a "Follow" button.

The application simulates loading data from a mock API and handles loading and error states, making it a functional example for learning basic React concepts.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface with a component-based approach.

Tailwind CSS: A CSS framework for fast and responsive styling.

Babel: Used via a CDN to compile JSX code into JavaScript that the browser can understand.

Lucide Icons: For the interface icons (playback, skip, etc.).

Features
Tracklist: Displays a list of tracks with their respective titles and artists.

Interactive Player: The player at the bottom of the screen allows you to play/pause, skip forward, and skip backward through the songs.

State Management: The application manages isLoading and error states, showing messages to the user as needed.

Follow Button: A dynamic button that changes state when clicked.

How to Run the Code
Since the application is contained in a single HTML file, it's very simple to run:

Copy all the code from the file into a text editor.

Save the file with the name index.html.

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

The application will load, and you can interact with it immediately.
